# MOC Project Tool

This is an Ansible project that reads project descriptions from a
collection of YAML files and uses that information to create projects,
quotas, and groups in OpenShift.

This project is available as a container image from
<https://quay.io/repository/larsks/moc-project-tool>. The image is
built automatically for each commit to this repository and tagged with
the commit id.

## Requirements

You will need the `kubernetes.core` collection to run this playbook.
To install the necessary requirements:

```
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yaml
```

## Configuration

The following two environment variables are "safeties" to avoid
accidentally modifying OpenShift while developing these playbooks. If
neither of these variables is set, the `manage-projects.yaml` playbook
runs in read-only mode:

- `ACTUALLY_CREATE_PROJECTS` -- the playbooks will not create
  resources in OpenShift unless this is `true`
- `ACTUALLY_DELETE_PROJECTS` -- the playbooks will not delete
  resources from OpenShift unless this is `true`

The following environment variables can be used to configure this
service:

- `PROJECT_DATA_REPO` -- the URL for the repository containing project
  definitions.
- `PROJECT_DATA_DIR` -- the local path where `PROJECT_DATA_REPO` will
  be checked out.
- `PROJECT_FORCE_TRIGGER` -- Process project files even if there are no
  changes in the repository.
- `PROJECT_ACCEPT_HOSTKEY` -- Configure ssh to accept unknown
  hostkeys.
- `PROJECT_SSH_KEY` -- Path to private ssh key used to authenticate to
  `PROJECT_DATA_REPO`.

## Quotas

Quotas are defined in the `quotas/` directory in
`quota/<quotaname>/resourcequota.yaml`. All quotas should be named
`default`, with their descriptive name store in the
`massopen.cloud/quota-name` annotation, like this:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: default
  annotations:
    massopen.cloud/quota-name: "x-small"
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: '500m'
    requests.memory: 2Gi
    limits.cpu: '500m'
    limits.memory: 2Gi
    requests.storage: 10Gi
```

This makes it easy to update quotas for an existing project.

If you add additional quotas to this repository, also update the JSON
schema in the [moc-openshift-projects][] repository.
